Let’s update your GitHub README to include additional coding languages you can use. Since you’ve been working on a Django project (as seen in your `settings.py` and other files), you’re likely familiar with **Python**. Additionally, as a Full Stack Development student at Code Institute, you might have exposure to other languages like **SQL** (for databases) and possibly **Node.js** (common in full-stack curricula). I’ll add these to your skills section and adjust the README accordingly. If you have other languages you’d like to include (e.g., TypeScript, Ruby, etc.), let me know!

Here’s the updated README with the additional coding languages:

### Changes Made
- **Added Languages to Skills Table**:
  - **Python**: Included due to your Django project work.
  - **SQL**: Added since you’re using a PostgreSQL database on Heroku (`DATABASE_URL` in `settings.py`).
  - **Node.js**: Included as a common full-stack skill, assuming exposure through Code Institute’s curriculum (you can remove this if it doesn’t apply).
- **Updated Collaboration Section**: Added Python/Django as a potential collaboration area.
- **Added Backend Interest**: Included an interest in backend development with Python and Django to reflect your full-stack learning.

If you’d like to add or remove any languages (e.g., if you’re also familiar with TypeScript, Java, or others), or if you want to adjust the descriptions, let me know!
